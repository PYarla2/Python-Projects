# Python-Projects
This repository contains all of the projects I have created using Python. 
I have worked on these small, topic focused projects to imporve my skills focus on the specific functions to learn how to control the elements are ordered and grouped. 
The AWS Porject is one of the most advanced project I have created. The focus of this project is to upload a certain file to AWS Server and an On-premise local server and record their upload speed. It uses the packages boto3 and parmiko to help connect to the servers. This was a year long research project.
